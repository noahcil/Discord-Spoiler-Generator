# Discord-Spoiler-Generator
Repository that hosts my Discord bubble wrap spoiler generator. It can be used to make discord bubble wrap text of any text, length, and size. Do not be concerned with the sussery in the code (which I will not be changing ðŸ˜¼), I originally made it as an Among Us themed joke but it's a general use tool.

## TODO
* fix divide by zero error when spoiler text is less than 2 characters
* figure out how to make it work symmetrically for spoiler text that isn't divisible by 2 or 3
