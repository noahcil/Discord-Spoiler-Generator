# Discord-Spoiler-Generator
Repository that hosts my Discord bubble wrap spoiler generator. It can be used to make discord bubble wrap text of any text, length, and size.
Feel free to recommend changes

## TODO
* fix divide by zero error when spoiler text is less than 2 characters
* figure out how to make it work symmetrically for spoiler text that isn't divisible by 2 or 3
